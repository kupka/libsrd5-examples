# libsrd5-examples-unity

A very simple example of how to integrate libsrd5 in a Unity3D project. WebGL Live Demo at https://kupka.github.io/libsrd5-examples/unity/index.html

# Disclaimer

My experience with Unity3D is very limited - please excuse if I'm implementing things in a weird way. This project is not meant to
be a Unity3D textbook reference project - it is meant to demonstrate how libsrd5 can be easily integrated. It also helps the development
of the library itself by finding caveats during integration and subsequently eliminating them.
